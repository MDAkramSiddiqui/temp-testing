          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mobile technology is a form of technology that is mostly used in
          cellular communication and other related aspects. It uses a form of
          platform where by many transmitters have the ability to send data at
          the same time on a single channel. This platform is called
          Code-division multiple access (CDMA). This platform allows many users
          to make use of single frequencies because it restricts the likelihood
          of interference of frequencies from two or more sources. This channel
          has evolved over the years. The mobile technology is rapidly evolving;
          over the years, its uses are becoming diverse and is gradually
          replacing some similar sources in the market that are also used for
          communication e.g. post office and land lines. The mobile technology
          has improved from a simple device used for phone call and messaging
          into a multi-tasking device used for GPS navigation, internet
          browsing, gaming, instant messaging tool etc. Professionals argue with
          the trend that the future of computer technology is rest on wireless
          networking and mobile computing. Mobile technology through tablet and
          portable computers are becoming more and more popular.

          History & Evolution
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mobile technology was a mystery two decades ago but now, it has become
          something of necessity to both the rural and the urban areas. The
          mobile technology started as a remarkable achievement in the world of
          technology but now, it is transforming into user comfort technology
          due to its present diverse functionality. When the mobile was first
          introduced, it used to be basically for SMS, Calls and games. But it
          has presently transformed into a digital world and has made life and
          business much easier; marketers now have the ability to sell their
          products with ease through mobiles technology. The mobile has made it
          possible for users to transfer files and other files through Bluetooth
          and wifi. The mobile is also equipped with internet connectivity,
          making it easy for the user to gain information and also to download
          files from the internet. Video call conferencing is another
          achievement that has come to reality through mobile technology.
          Business men and clients now have the channel to communicate even
          without seeing in person. With the use of mobile technology, it is now
          easy to catch up with every form of entertainment from the comfort of
          your home. It has also made it possible for one to easily locate
          places on the globe using the Global positioning system (GPS).
          Especially in the business world, the importance of mobile technology
          cannot be overemphasized; bankers depend solely on mobile technology
          on managing finances and stocks. Many business firms uses the mobile
          technology to increase their earnings through providing customers
          easiness to patronize their product through apps and websites. For
          example, the Cinema may create an app for ticket booking; railway
          travel tickets can be purchased from the internet without having to
          queue up to purchase it. The evolvement of mobile technology has made
          our life easier and also saves us time and resources.

          Diversity and Development
        </h2>
        <p>
          The diversity of mobile technology is due to the fact that that many
          mobile operating systems are available for smart phones all of which
          have their own unique characteristics. Some of these operating systems
          are: the Android, blackberry, webos, ios, symbian windows and bada
          mobile some of which will be briefly discussed: The android is an
          operating system that is developed by google. The operating system is
          designed basically for the touch screen mobile devices and it is based
          on a simple manipulation. It uses simple touch gestures that relates
          to the real world situation. The Android is the first and only open
          source operating system; that means it has the ability to be ported to
          any cell phone. The blackberry is an operating system developed by the
          Blackberry limited. The operating system was developed mainly for
          Blackberry smart phones. This system is most specialized for
          multitasking and also aids the use of some specific inputs for the
          supports of some of its smart phones such as the trackwheel,
          trackball, trackball, trackpad and touchscreen. The IOS is a mobile
          operating system that is made and developed by Apple. The system was
          developed for the use of the Apple hardware only such as Iphone, Ipad
          and Ipod Touch. Since 2008 the operating system customized their
          platforms, allowing the user to download any app he wishes to download
          like the gaming app, the utility apps, the GPS and other tools. Any
          user that have the knowledge to create an app and also wishes to
          create one can legally do so. The WebOS basically has the ability to
          support internet programming languages some of which are HTML,
          JavaScript, and CSS. The internet is now equipped with a 4G network.
          This network enables a high speed data transmission in the channels,
          making surfing the internet to be easier. In the future, smart phones
          will be aware of their environment, they are going to be able to
          utilize the availability of physical inbuilt sensors and the ease with
          which data are exchanged. One of the way to achieve these trend is
          that the mobile phones will begin to keep track of the userâ€™s personal
          data, but also, they will be able to predict almost correctly the user
          intentions on what he wants to use or the information he is interested
          in getting. This will be accomplished by keeping track of the user
          earlier tasks. In the next generation of mobile technology, smart
          phones will be equipped with X-Ray tool that will be able to detect
          detail information about the location the phone is pointing to at that
          particular time. Various companies are presently developing apps that
          will be able to accurately sense the exact location or present
          position of the phone or the user. Along with the future of mobile
          technology comes another device called Omnitouch this is a device that
          makes it possible for application to be used on the hand, arm, desk,
          wall and every other plain surface. The device has a sensor touch
          interface which makes it possible for the user to access functions
          through the use of the finger touch. Since the arrival of the mobile,
          it has helped humans in many ways; some of which are: mobile phones
          are very important in case of an emergency they safe lives in cases of
          accidents and other related issues. One of the most important use of
          smart phones is that they ensure safety. Families can easily
          communicate with each other while away. To cap it up, mobile
          technology is here to stay and holds a lot more features in the future
          to meet even the most of our basic needs and to make life a lot
          easier.
