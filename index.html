      <div class="blog-body">
        For small and midsize businesses (SMBs), the benefits of cloud computing
        are endless. Cloud computing saves businesses time and money by boosting
        productivity, improving collaboration and promoting innovation.
        Businesses use cloud computing to access information anywhere with any
        compatible device. Rather than storing information on your computer or a
        server in your office, cloud computing stores data on the internet. It
        works by making information available from a central web-based hub that
        gives anyone with proper credentials access from any location with an
        internet connection. Cloud computing also syncs data for all devices
        connected to the cloud, keeping them updated with real-time information.
        In the cloud environment, users can access all types of files, use
        applications as though they were in the office, and even collaborate
        remotely while working on the same project or presentation on their
        device as someone on the other side of the globe. Even if you're away
        from work or your office server is inaccessible, data in the cloud is
        always up to date and available wherever, whenever. Cloud-computing
        services can range from data storage to functional programs, including
        accounting, customer service tools and remote desktop hosting.

        <h2 class="blog-h2">
          What types of cloud services do businesses use?
        </h2>
        Business owners use three types of cloud services to store their data
        and provide services: public, private and hybrid. Public cloud: A public
        cloud service is built on an external platform run by a cloud service
        provider. With this off-site cloud service, users get their own cloud
        within a shared infrastructure. The provider offers everything from
        system resources to the security and maintenance of your cloud system.
        Since it is managed by an outside company specializing in cloud services
        for a wide range of customers, a public cloud system is great for
        organizations that want more elasticity, cost-effectiveness and the
        latest technology. Private cloud: A https://www.businessnewsdaily.com
        service is a cloud platform built within your own walls on your own
        hardware and software. Since a private cloud is managed by your own
        internal IT team, it is ideal for businesses that want exclusive access,
        more flexibility and greater control over their cloud. To use a private
        cloud service, however, organizations build their own data centers,
        making it a costlier cloud option.

        <h2 class="blog-h2">How much does cloud computing cost?</h2>
        The cost of cloud computing varies greatly, depending largely on the
        type of cloud service you need. For instance, cloud storage and
        file-sharing services like Dropbox start with free accounts, but paid
        plans with advanced features cost $20 and up per month per user. Cloud
        backup and recovery services like Carbonite cost $59.99 per month.
        Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, offers a wide range of cloud
        services, letting you use its data centers for free or on a
        pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud-based software pricing also depends on the
        provider and industry. Other factors that affect SaaS pricing include
        the number of users, how you will be launching and distributing the
        software across the company, tech support, and contract terms.
